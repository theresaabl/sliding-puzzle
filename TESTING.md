## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

| Directory | File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [index.html](https://theresaabl.github.io/sliding-puzzle/index.html) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-index.png) | On first validation there was a number of errors, which were easily fixed. ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-index-errors.png) |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate my CSS file.

## Browser Compatibility

I have tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues. The browsers I have tested on are:
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)

| Browser | Landing modal | Main game | Win message | New game modal | Leaderboard | Rules | 404 page | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | -- |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-chrome-landing.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-chrome-main-game.png) |![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-chrome-win-message.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-chrome-new-game.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-chrome-leaderboard.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-chrome-rules.png)  | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-chrome-404.png) |  Works as expected |
| Firefox | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-firefox-landing.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-firefox-main-game.png) |![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-firefox-win-message.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-firefox-new-game.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-firefox-leaderboard.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-firefox-rules.png)  | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-firefox-404.png) |  There is a bug showing up in Firefox: When clicking on the select elements in the new game or win modals, the modal closes immediately without letting the user select an option. The select element can however be accessed via keyboard. This issue comes from the function that handles when a user clicks outside the modal. In other browsers clicking outside the modal closes it, but nothing happens when clicking inside it. However in Firefox, clicking on a select element returns  e.clientX and e.clientY of 0, which leads to the modal closing. See also e.g. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77402658/why-does-clicking-a-select-dropdown-inside-a-form-embedded-in-a-modal-dialog-clo). A quick solution would be to leave this functionality out as the user can also close the modal by clicking the close button and pressing the escape key. However, for the purpose of this release I decided to leave this functionality in, and Firefox users can control the select elements via keyboard. |

## Responsiveness

I have tested my deployed project on multiple devices to check for responsiveness issues. I first tested many different device sizes in Chrome DevTools and then tested the site on different physical devices. The screenshots below are from the real devices.

## Lighthouse Audit

I have tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

## Defensive Programming

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!

When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each.
Examples of this could include (not limited to):

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form
- Users must enter valid email addresses

PP3 (Python-only):
- Users must enter a valid letter/word/string when prompted
- Users must choose from a specific list only

MS3 (Flask) | MS4/PP4/PP5 (Django):
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page
- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form,
or uses CRUD functionality for data manipulation on a database.
Make sure to include the `required` attribute on any form-fields that should be mandatory.
Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser).

You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

Testing should be replicable.
Ideally, tests cases should focus on each individual section of every page on the website.
Each test case should be specific, objective, and step-wise replicable.

Instead of adding a general overview saying that everything works fine,
consider documenting tests on each element of the page
(ie. button clicks, input box validation, navigation links, etc.) by testing them in their happy flow,
and also the bad/exception flow, mentioning the expected and observed results,
and drawing a parallel between them where applicable.

Consider using the following format for manual test cases:

Expected Outcome / Test Performed / Result Received / Fixes Implemented

- **Expected**: "Feature is expected to do X when the user does Y."
- **Testing**: "Tested the feature by doing Y."
- (either) **Result**: "The feature behaved as expected, and it did Y."
- (or) **Result**: "The feature did not respond to A, B, or C."
- **Fix**: "I did Z to the code because something was missing."

Use the table below as a basic start, and expand on it using the logic above.

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

Another way of performing defensive testing is a simple Pass/Fail for each test.
The assessors prefer the above method, with the full test explained, but this is also acceptable in most cases.

When in doubt, use the above method instead, and delete the table below.
